> This project is a Java-based simulation designed to model the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases within a closed population. Using **Agent-Based Modeling (ABM)**, I simulated individual interactions to observe how variables like infection rate, recovery time, and social distancing impact the overall "curve" of an outbreak.
